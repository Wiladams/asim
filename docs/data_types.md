# Data Types
ASIM has a few useful core data types

bool            true | false</br>
number          floating point</br>
string          () - anyting in between parens<br/>
array           [] - elements between square brackets<br/>
procedure       {} - operators and operands between curly braces<br/>
filestream      access to a stream of bytes
literal name    /name - series of characters with a leading '/'
name            name - series of characters without leading '/'
dictionary      <<>>

ASIM achieves expressiveness by utilizing these core data types in various ways.
Along with language syntax, variables, and functions can be constructed fairly easily.
